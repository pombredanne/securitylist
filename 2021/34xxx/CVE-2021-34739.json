This vulnerability is due to insufficient expiration of session credentials. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by conducting a man-in-the-middle attack against an affected device to intercept valid session credentials and then replaying the intercepted credentials toward the same device at a later time. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access the web-based management interface with administrator privileges."
